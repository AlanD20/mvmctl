# v0.3.0 Release Tasks

This checklist implements `tasks/plan.md`. Go production and L0/L1 work belongs to the `engineer`; Python
`tests/system/` and release verification belongs to the `qa-engineer`; ADRs, plans, and documentation belong to the
`architect`. The architect reviews the actual diff after every implementation slice.

## Accepted Work (2026-10-16)

- [x] Integrate the approved security/lifecycle implementation and recorded decisions linked from [plan.md](plan.md).
- [x] Accept Go CI, root-Jailer, build and inner-install gates against unchanged relevant candidate inputs.
- [x] Accept candidate565's approved mixed-source runtime join: 528/528, comprising 504 source-bound carried cases,
  22 fresh kernel cases and two stock host-reboot phases. Preserve actual execution sources and original receipts.
- [x] Reconcile final operator/QA documentation through `8690e916`; preserve qualification limits and provenance.

Candidate identity and detailed evidence are in the
[coverage matrix](../tests/system/COVERAGE_MATRIX.md) and
[system-test execution guide](../docs/development/HOW_TO_RUN_SYSTEM_TESTS.md).
Successful local QA, builds and installations need no replay for documentation-only changes.

## Remaining Release Steps

- [ ] Integrate reviewed documentation cleanup, retaining unrelated user edits unchanged. Owner: architect/integrator.
- [ ] Push the authorized `0.3.0-release` branch and observe remote CI for the pushed commit. Owner: integrator.
  Follow the current [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) and [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md);
  local acceptance is not remote CI evidence.
- [ ] Present the final diff, local qualification, remote CI and limitations for the user's release approval.
  Owner: architect/integrator. Tag/publication remains subject to that decision and [RELEASE.md](../docs/RELEASE.md).

## Deferred, Not Release Blockers

- aarch64 runtime qualification awaits available hardware; cross-builds do not qualify runtime support.
- The other explicit feature deferrals and memory-policy limits remain in [plan.md](plan.md).

Historical unchecked implementation tasks are superseded by the accepted work above. Use Git history for prior
progress records and the linked ADRs for design contracts; do not restart obsolete implementation or QA diaries.
